30 projects with JavaScript

As I want my JS skills to grow I decided to pick up a challenge that Wes Bos came up with.
30 days -> 30 projects
I didn't want to flood my github with 30 smaller projects so I decided to keep them all in one repository.

What did I learn so far:

- querySelector
- new backticks from ES6 usage
- kbd tag (neat!)
- pure CSS variables
- console.table (woah!)
- array.map & array.sort & array.reduce
- flex gallery (I need to read more about this, looks awesome)
- fetch() <- my favourite so far
- array.some & array.find
- destructuring assignment
- console.time for checking how long things take
- window.scrollY
- Object.assign
- trim() - removes whitespace from both sides of a string
- camera manipulation (day 19 is insane!)
